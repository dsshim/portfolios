# David Shim - M4 Portfolio

### My Mission

After completing Module 3 and learning advanced Rails techniques, my goal this module was to learn as much JavaScript as possible.  After beginning the job hunt, I quickly saw how important of a skill it is for a full-stack web developer.  Not knowing any JS before this module, I now feel comfortable adding JQuery, AJAX, and ES5/6 to my resume.  

### Projects

## Team

I completed the following group projects for this module:

#### GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/RickBacci/tron)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

In this two-week project, we dove head first into writing a game in JavaScript. It was extremely intimidating at first but Steve's lectures provided us with all the basics that we needed to complete it.  I had a lot of fun making this game and hope this isn't my last.

* Functional Expectations: 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and        one extension

* Test-Driven Development: 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

* Breaking Logic into Components: 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

* Fundamental JavaScript & Style: 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### My Contribution

With this project, I tried to work on as many aspects as I could since it was all new to me.  Ricky and I worked well together and were able to support each other when things got difficult.  Despite the challenges that we faced, I believe that we were able to deliver a good project.

##### Takeaway

* Learned how write something that works in JavaScript.
* Learned how to use an HTML5 canvas.
* Learned the value of focusing on UX and code quality.
* Learned that JavaScript testing is difficult but possible.
* Focused on efficient project management while working with others.

## Individual

I completed the following individual projects for this module.

#### ScaleUp

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dsshim/keevah)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown)

This 3 day project was a nice break from JavaScript.  It really helped sharpen my ActiveRecord skills and also brought up the new issue of heavy load on a Rails app.  It was quite a challenge getting the free level Heroku servers to cooperate.  

* Production Deployment and Performance Monitoring: (1 - 4): 4
* Load Testing / User Scripting: (1 - 4): 3+
* Database Load: (1 - 4): 3
* Performance Optimization Techniques: (1 - 4): 4
* Additional Features: (1 - 4): 4


##### Takeaway

* Learned how to track performance via specific database calls.
* Learned how to use Bullet to detect N+1 Queries
* Solidified my previous knowledge of caching from Module 3
* Learned how to navigate through a foreign codebase.


#### RealTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dsshim/crowdsource)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

This week-long project was our first introduction to web sockets. While the project was pretty complex, I think I learned a lot.  I plan on refactoring the codebase a bit to make this a marquee project in my portfolio.




##### Takeaway

* Learned how to update client pages in real-time using web sockets.
* Became more comfortable with JQuery and AJAX.
* More practice using Node.js and Express


## Community

### Giving Feedback

* To Ricky(GameTime): "I really enjoyed working on this project.  I think we worked really well together.  When one of us was having an issue, the other was always able to quickly get the problem solved.  While you may need some guidance, once pushed in the right direction, you were able to get some great work done!"
